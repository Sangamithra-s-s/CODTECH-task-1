OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
PROJECT : DATA INGESTION WITH APACHE KAFKA

#### Objective
The primary goal of this project is to set up Apache Kafka for data ingestion and streaming, thereby gaining a solid understanding of event streaming and data processing. You will create Kafka producers and consumers using Java or Python and learn how to stream and process data effectively.

#### Key Components
1. **Apache Kafka Setup**:
   - **Zookeeper**: Essential for managing Kafka's distributed cluster.
   - **Kafka Broker**: Handles the storage and management of the stream of records (messages).

2. **Kafka Producers**:
   - **Role**: Send data (messages) to Kafka topics.
   - **Implementation**: Write producers in Java or Python to push data into Kafka.

3. **Kafka Consumers**:
   - **Role**: Read and process data from Kafka topics.
   - **Implementation**: Write consumers in Java or Python to retrieve and process data from Kafka.

#### Steps to Accomplish the Project
1. **Install and Configure Kafka**:
   - Download and set up Apache Kafka and Zookeeper on your machine.
   - Verify the setup by running Zookeeper and Kafka broker.

2. **Create Kafka Topics**:
   - Use Kafka commands to create topics, which act as categories for message streams.

3. **Develop Kafka Producers**:
   - Write Java or Python code to create producers that send data to Kafka topics.
   - Test the producers to ensure they are sending messages to the topics.

4. **Develop Kafka Consumers**:
   - Write Java or Python code to create consumers that read data from Kafka topics.
   - Test the consumers to ensure they are receiving and processing messages correctly.

5. **Stream and Process Data**:
   - Implement a simple use case where data is generated by the producer, sent to Kafka, and consumed and processed by the consumer.
   - Monitor the data flow to understand real-time data streaming and processing.

#### Expected Outcomes
- **Understanding of Kafka Components**: Gain knowledge about Kafka, Zookeeper, brokers, producers, and consumers.
- **Hands-On Experience**: Develop practical skills by writing producers and consumers in Java or Python.
- **Data Streaming and Processing**: Learn how to stream data in real-time and perform basic processing on the streamed data.
- **Real-World Application**: Apply the knowledge to real-world scenarios, such as logging, event sourcing, and data pipelines.
